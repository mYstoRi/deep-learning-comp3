not all important files are included in the GitHub. So if you wish to run the notebook, please follow these steps:

0. clone / pull the repo

1. go to the Kaggle page
	https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2024-datalab-cup-3-reverse-image-caption/overview

2. download the dataset and unzip it somewhere else

3. copy only the testing folder from the unzipped dataset over to the repository.

4. type this in the url 
	https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4?tf-hub-format=compressed
	it will download a tar.gz. unzip it and put it in checkpoints/universal_sentense_encoder/

5. (if you don't have 4 gpus which is probably always) comment out  the 39th line because this only works when you have 4 gpus for some reason.



If you want to submit a result to Kaggle, run the entire notebook.
the output should be in testing/output.csv.
This can be changed in the last command line in the notebook.
